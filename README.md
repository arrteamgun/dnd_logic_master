# dnd_logic_master
BE for DnD helper

This is my first solid backend. Here I'm trying to train basic skills such as MVC pattern, .NET controllers and such.
The goal is - to create a good backend with the business logic that allows other app to get: dice rolls, characters and basic information like spells, weapons and armor.
